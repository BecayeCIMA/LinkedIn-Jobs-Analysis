Computer Vision Engineer | Real-Time Perception for Robotics & Self-Driving Systems | On-Site (Toronto) | $130K–$180K + Equity,White Bay,,,"About the job
The Company
White Bay’s client is a forward-thinking robotics startup transforming smart home environments using real-time AI and perception systems. Founded by a designer-engineer, they’re building a product ecosystem where machines interact intelligently with the physical world—beyond traditional rule-based automation.

Instead of basic triggers and scripts, their platform is powered by full-body and hand motion tracking. They’re creating systems that can see, interpret, and respond to human behavior in real time, similar to the perception challenges seen in autonomous vehicles. Backed by a strong research team, they’re now doubling down on engineering execution—with a clear path to commercial launch.

The Role
White Bay’s client is hiring a Computer Vision Engineer for a full-time, on-site role in Toronto. This is a product-facing, execution-first position focused on real-world deployment, not experimentation. You'll build and ship perception systems for robotics—pushing CV pipelines from concept into live environments under production constraints.

This role is ideal for someone who has worked on perception stacks in self-driving cars, robotics, or other real-time edge deployments involving sensor fusion, 3D reconstruction, and embedded performance optimization.

Key Requirements
Self-Driving / Autonomous Systems Experience (Must-Have): Direct exposure to building perception systems for self-driving cars, either at major OEMs (Tesla, GM, Waymo, etc.), their subsidiaries, or third-party vendors supporting autonomous vehicle development. Candidates without this will be a hard pass.
Computer Vision (5+ years): Solid background in CV model development, sensor data fusion, and live inference using camera, depth, and LIDAR streams.
Production-Grade Deployment: You’ve shipped real CV-powered products, not just demos or academic prototypes.
Programming: Strong skills in Python and C++, with a focus on performance, reliability, and modularity.
Sensor Fusion: Able to combine multimodal data (RGB, depth, IMU, etc.) into usable perception logic.
Embedded + Edge Experience: Proven ability deploying models to embedded systems or robotics stacks.
Builder’s Mindset: You move fast, think pragmatically, and ship under constraints.

Responsibilities
Build and deploy real-time vision pipelines to power intelligent robotics.
Integrate CV systems with robotic platforms, actuators, and sensors.
Work closely with AI researchers to optimize and productize models.
Own deployment, performance tuning, and reliability testing in live environments.
Bring a delivery-first mentality—this team is shipping, not publishing.

Why Apply?
The company has no shortage of research firepower. What they need is a strong builder—someone who can take vision systems all the way to production. If you've worked on perception for self-driving cars, industrial robots, or complex sensor-driven systems, this is a unique opportunity to bring those skills into a new, high-impact environment.
This isn’t theoretical—it’s a real robotics product headed for the market. One of their senior engineers is transitioning out, and they’re actively looking to fill that execution-focused gap with someone who’s shipped before.

Compensation & Details
Salary: $130,000 – $180,000 CAD depending on experience
Equity: Available after 1 year (negotiable for the right candidate)
Location: On-site only (Toronto)
Hours: Structured 9:00 AM – 6:30 PM workday
Team: Work alongside elite AI researchers and engineers
Product: Contribute directly to the launch of a first-of-its-kind AI robotics platform

Ready to Apply?
If you’re excited by robotics, real-time perception, and deploying AI into the real world—and you’ve seen the complexity of AV or self-driving environments firsthand—this role was built for you.

"Member of Technical Staff, Field Application Engineering – Software, 3D Sensing & LiDAR",Lumotive,,,"About the job
Lumotive is pioneering the era of programmable optics—where light is controlled as intelligently and flexibly as software.

At the heart of this transformation is a once-in-a-generation innovation: a flat CMOS-based “general purpose optic.” Lumotive’s Light Control Metasurface (LCM™) beam forming chips can be programmed to function as a beam steering mirror, a lens, mirror, a beam splitter—or any optical function—replacing bulky and mechanical optical components with a fully digital, reconfigurable semiconductor . This breakthrough lays the foundation for a massive shift in multiple technologies—from 3D sensing and imaging to optical networking, free space optical communication, and beyond. Like the shift from analog to digital in electronics, programmable optics will reshape industries from robotics, self-driving cars, AI, defense, and healthcare.

Lumotive’s first commercial application is in LiDAR, where its software-defined beam steering chips are already enabling compact, high-performance, solid-state sensors. These sensors are being deployed today in smart infrastructure, robotics, and mobility systems through leading module makers and solution integrators.

With more than 200 patents and growing commercial traction, Lumotive is delivering the world’s first digital platform for light—and redefining what’s possible in the optical age.
