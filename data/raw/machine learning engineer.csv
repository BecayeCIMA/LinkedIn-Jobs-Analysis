About Ares
The Problem
Personal injury (PI) law is a $50+ B industry starved for technology. Every case spawns mountains of medical records and time-sucking documents that slow justice for the injured.

Our Solution
Ares flips the script. Our AI engine already turns raw medical records into a crystal-clear medical summaries in minutes and drafts legal documents that get insurers moving. 

By using Ares, firms get:
99% reduction in medical records review
Increase revenue by 20% without additional headcount
Get justice for victims, faster

Our Mission
Our current platform is just chapter one. We’re racing toward a future where every repetitive task in PI law is eliminated via AI automation—globally.

Founded by an ex-Meta tech lead (YC & Antler alum) who’s shipped products to billions, we’re profitable, trusted by firms across the US, and backed by furious customer pull.

About the Role
You’ll be the first engineering hire and technical counterpart to the founder. Our job: turn Ares into the AI operating system for every personal injury firm on earth. Expect full ownership of architecture, code, infra, and product decisions—because there’s nobody to “hand work off” to yet.

What you’ll do:
Own major features end-to-end: API design, backend logic, frontend UI, and everything in between
Productionize LLM workloads (RAG, evals, fine-tuning) at scale.
Work closely with customers to understand what matters, then ship fast
Help shape our engineering culture, system architecture, and technical roadmap
Solve real problems for real businesses, not imaginary ones

The ideal candidate:
Has built and shipped meaningful software at high-growth startups or tech-forward companies
Hands-on with LLMs (prompt engineering, RAG, evals, fine-tuning).
Understands tradeoffs, knows when to move fast, and when to polish
Doesn’t need permission to start something, but knows when to ask for input
Wants to own real outcomes—not just code
Thrive in an on-site, 6-days a week, “ship-it-today” environment

Why join us:
Competitive compensation, with generous founding equity. This also means that we expect a lot from you.
Build on a once-in-a-generation AI wave and see direct customer impact every week.
Clear path to senior leadership as we scale engineering.
Thrive in a high-energy, six-day in-office environment - constant white-board jams, instant feedback loops, and Friday demos followed by happy hour.
Achieve explosive personal and professional growth while we build Ares into a unicorn. 

Our Stack
Backend: Python, Flask 
Frontend: React/Next.JS, TypeScript, Tailwind
Infra: AWS, Supabase, Railway 
AI: OpenAI, LangSmith, Pydantic

Interview Process
The entire process has 4 steps and takes around 1.5 week in total:
Initial 15-30 minute phone screening interview.
One 30-45 minute technical interview.
One week fully-paid work trial.
Full-time offer.

You'll be working with the founders directly throughout the entire process."
