About The Team And Role

Machine Learning plays an important role in helping Quora further its mission of growing and sharing the world's knowledge. We have 100+ Machine Learning models in production powering various product features. We use a variety of algorithms — everything from linear models to decision trees and deep neural networks. Our production models operate at a huge scale and help over a hundred million people using Quora every month.

We want to empower all ML engineers at Quora to be as impactful as they can be in solving different ML problems at scale. To that end, we are looking for engineers to help us build our company-wide ML development platform. In this role, you will be the part of a small team solving very interesting technical problems at the intersection of exciting domains like Machine Learning, Distributed Systems and High Performance Computing. Your work will have an enormous impact on Quora's long-term success. This role will focus primarily on ML infrastructure and Distributed System (80%), with some involvement in supporting model deployment (20%).
