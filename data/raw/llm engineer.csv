Développeur(se) expert(e) en intelligence artificielle,Vitr.ai,"Quebec, Canada",Remote,"About the job
Vitrai est à la recherche d’un(e) développeur(se) expert(e) en intelligence artificielle

🧠 À propos de Vitrai

Fondée en 2017, Vitrai développe des technologies venant en aide aux cliniques médicales et aux centres d’appels (8-1-1, GAP, etc.) à travers le Canada afin d’orienter chaque patient vers le bon professionnel de la santé, au bon moment. 

Depuis le lancement de notre premier logiciel d’orientation Navig en décembre 2022, plusieurs centaines de milliers de patients ont bénéficié de notre travail. Certaines personnes ont été «sauvées grâce à l’intelligence artificielle», alors que plusieurs autres ont été vues plus rapidement par le bon professionnel de la santé, sans l’ajout de ressources professionnelles (au grand plaisir des cliniques médicales qui remportent des prix d’excellence en adoptant notre logiciel). 

Plus récemment, notre entreprise s’est vue décerner un contrat par Santé Québec pour déployer notre intelligence artificielle partout au Québec.

🦸🏽‍♀️ Comment sommes-nous ?

Notre équipe est entièrement composée de personnes intelligentes, humbles, honnêtes, assoiffées de connaissances et désireuses d’avoir un impact considérable dans la vie de millions de patients. Nous privilégions une approche de «densité de talents», c’est-à-dire une équipe composée de relativement peu de personnes, toutes très talentueuses! Vous travaillerez avec des experts hautement qualifiés, chaque jour.

Chaque matin, nous entrons au bureau avec un seul but : faire en sorte que plus de patients aient accès aux soins qu’ils requièrent sans ajouter de pression sur les humains qui tiennent le réseau de santé et de services sociaux à bout de bras. 

Ce dernier passage est très important pour nous, puisqu’une grande partie de notre équipe a travaillé pendant plusieurs années dans le réseau public des soins de santé.

🎯 Pourquoi c’est le meilleur moment pour se joindre à nous ?

1. Construire; 2. Prouver la valeur; 3. Mettre à l’échelle.

Nous sommes aujourd’hui à l’étape de la mise à l’échelle. Cela veut dire que nous travaillons maintenant à repenser nos processus et à systématiser notre approche afin de permettre à nos produits de bénéficier à un maximum de patients, ici au Québec, et partout sur Terre.

Si tu cherches : 
à être parmi les premières personnes à joindre une équipe, mais sans être à l’étape où tout est à bâtir;

⚙️ Nos méthodes de travail

Nous avons une approche par cycle, selon laquelle nos grands objectifs d’entreprise sont «découpés en petites bouchées», puis distribués à des responsables d’objectifs parmi l’équipe, pour nous permettre de progresser rapidement, d’entretenir notre «biais vers l’action» et ainsi aider le maximum de patients à obtenir le rendez-vous dont ils ont besoin.

Nous avons adopté une culture du travail hybride, ayant des collègues d’un peu partout au Québec. Une fois par cycle, environ, nous réunissons toute l’équipe à nos bureaux de Granby afin de célébrer nos réalisations et planifier notre prochain cycle. 

Nous communiquons beaucoup par écrit, pour éviter la répétition, les rencontres inutiles et faire bénéficier tous nos collègues des messages importants.
