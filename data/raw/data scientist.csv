Data Scientist,Jerry,"Greater Toronto Area, Canada",Remote,"About the job
You could be a data scientist anywhere. Why us?

Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth

About The Opportunity

Jerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years — scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company’s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible – insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc – a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

How You Will Make An Impact

Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency 

Preferred Experience

Bachelor’s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
High level of comfort with SQL or Python

Who You Are

You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company’s C-suite
You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence

Requisition ID: 227110

Join a purpose driven winning team, committed to results, in an inclusive and high-performing culture.

Job Title: Senior Manager, Decisioning Models - Retail & Small Business 

We are committed to investing in our employees and helping you continue your career at Scotiabank.

The world is changing faster than ever and so are we! “Big data”, “machine learning” and “AI” are not just buzzwords; they are an ever-increasing part of our daily life. We have decades of data powering hundreds of models deployed across a multitude of systems that are crying out for smart talented team players who are results-oriented, embrace transformational challenges and relish the opportunity to help us turn our vision into reality.

Our goal is to be nothing less than The Leading Bank in The Americas by putting Customers First. Achieving this requires a Winning Team that can build, manage, and govern stable high-performing models and provide our business partners with the best analytic insights and advice possible. To put things in perspective, the models that we build underpin automated risk-management decisions and forecasts that impact millions of customers and keep hundreds of $millions safe every single day.

What We Are Looking For?

We want talented, pragmatic analytically oriented data scientists who are equally at home interpreting and applying statistics as they are ingesting and massaging data, translating regulatory requirements into models, and explaining complex issues in simple concise ways. We want bright and energetic minds who come armed with a bottomless sense of curiosity about everything (great models and analytics are about so much more than just the numbers!), a passion for getting things done right – the first time – and a deep sense of personal and professional accountability.

To be a Senior Manager in Retail and Small Business Models, Analytics & Strategy, it isn’t enough to just be a great model developer (though that is incredibly important as well); you also need to be an aspiring leader who dreams about ownership and accountability (i.e., “the buck stops here”), a collaborative team player who actively listens to stakeholders and customers because you are passionate about helping them win and you need to be interested in building something lasting and great. Working with internal customers (stakeholders) across the bank to understand and translate their needs into outcomes, exploring both novel and legacy data sets and methodologies, collaborating with technology partners to get things implemented flawlessly, and monitoring, tuning up (when necessary), and governing the models that your team “owns” will all be equally important.

Make an Impact

As a Senior Manager, you will report directly to a director, likely with 1-3 direct reports of your own, and you will be a critical member of a team overseeing a portfolio of decisioning models and analytic processes. You will support – from conception through execution and governance – models covering the Bank’s retail and small business product lines in Canada and Internationally. You will collaborate, on a regular basis, with a wide range of stakeholders and internal partners which may include Retail Credit Risk and Business, Capital, Provisioning, Model Operations, Enterprise Stress Testing, Model Validation and Governance, Technology & Data, Finance, Compliance and Audit.

You will have access to both traditional SAS tools and a modern machine learning stack that includes on-premise GPU computing, open source Jupiter development environments, a Hadoop cluster, containerized API model deployment and data visualization business intelligence tools.

Under the guidance of your director, your team of risk modeling experts will use these tools to develop advanced risk prediction models that will be used to make decisions worth $millions every month and therefore they need to be not only precise and accurate, but highly stable, explainable, compliant, secure, and useful. You will be responsible for understanding the goals & priorities set for you, executing them efficiently with a perpetual eye on quality, asking questions often and delivering results in harmony with your teammates.

Is This Role Right for You?

You believe, first and foremost, in always doing the right thing and doing things the right way.
You are both deeply curious and highly pragmatic.
You are comfortable with ambitious but realistic goals and are committed to achieving them.
You are social, engaging, not afraid to ask questions and relish the opportunity to learn from partners across the firm (who may be less technical than you)
You relish the opportunity and yet also understand the responsibility and weight that comes with the fact that the output of your models will directly influence the bank’s financial statements or decisions that impacts a real human being.
You have a genuine love, passion and talent for programming, data, and predictive modeling.
You are committed to quality in everything you do – statistically, process and governance wise.
You look forward to sharing your insights through high-quality verbal & written communications.

Sample Projects That You Might Work On Include

Complete specialized analysis, develop statistical solutions and recommend improvements to estimation techniques and/or forecasting and decisioning models.
Collaborate with risk management, vendors, technology, foreign counterparts, and compliance +audit to ensure effective governance, measurement & communication of model performance.
Conduct research of new innovative modeling methodologies, tools, and regulatory requirements
Lead the periodic monitoring, recalibration and maintenance of models and analytic tools.
Identify, promote, and lead process improvements for model development and monitoring.
Ensure that the data used for model development is reliable and robust and that it adheres to industry and regulatory standards.

A demonstrated history of analytic problem solving and sound judgment.
Experience as an analyst or data scientist with a track record of accomplishments working on cross-functional teams.

Job Summary

The Sea Around Us is a research initiative, which, since its inception in 1994, has made available an online searchable Atlas of reconstructed marine capture fisheries catches from 1950 to the present of all maritime countries of the world via its website at www.seaaroundus.org. This global catch database permits the testing of fisheries-related global hypotheses applied to marine conservation concerns and has served as the underlying database for many articles published by the Sea Around Us members and their collaborations in peer-reviewed journals.

Recently, the Sea Around Us obtained support from Minderoo Foundation for a project that will have an 18-month duration. This project’s objective is to update the catch reconstructions of the world’s maritime fishing nations to the most recent year (2022). This project includes the updates to 2022 or most recent year, the associated databases on price, end-use, fishing access and high seas catches.

In addition, the Sea Around Us embarked on the reconstructions of the world’s inland fisheries, with the recent publication of a first in a series of such reconstructions for Canada, the USA State of Minnesota, ten country members of the ASEAN and all countries in Africa.

The Sea Around Us envisions the continuation of the assessment of the world’s fish stocks based on the reconstructed catches and the estimation of maximum sustainable yields (CMSY/BSM) method developed by Rainer Froese and colleagues through the Minderoo Project.

The Data Science Specialist will: 1) review empirical data and algorithms applied to the price, end-use, fishing effort and layer 3 databases and develop code that imputes missing data to complete gaps in these databases associated with reconstructed catches; 2) investigate the 2022 update of reconstructed catches to identify patterns (which might apply AI) in the catch trends that might be used towards projecting future trends that might help in automating future reconstruction updates; 3) propose novel ways of summarizing Sea Around Us data or identify elements that are the most needed by users and develop views to these elements in collaboration with the Sea Around Us Website and Database Specialist; 4) conceive and develop novel ways of analyzing the Sea Around Us datasets in close collaboration with the PI and Research Unit Manager; 5) 6)participate in the development of spatialized components to map distribution of species and allocated reconstructed catches; and 6) participate in the allocation of reconstructed catches to half degree cells.

The ideal candidate should have extensive experience with working with large datasets (over 1 billion rows) on fisheries and biological life history traits and be familiar with statistical and mathematical derivations of empirical datasets. The candidate will also be required to have good knowledge of the Sea Around Us infrastructure and the principles behind this infrastructure, and a working knowledge of several languages such as PostGres, MS Excel, JavaScript, Python, C# and R. It is important for the candidate to be adept with QGIS and PostGIS. The ideal candidate should be able to implement ideas and tasks requested by the PI and delegate specific data-related tasks to Sea Around Us teams. The Data Science Specialist will be working in close collaboration with the Website and Database Specialist in order to maintain operations, integrity, troubleshooting and maintenance of the Sea Around Us tech stack.
