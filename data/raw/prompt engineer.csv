Développeur.euse fullstack intermédiaire/senior spécialisé.e en intelligence artificielle,TLM,"Quebec, Canada",Remote,"About the job
On a reçu beaucoup de candidatures dernièrement, et comme on sait que ton temps est précieux :
Il faut absolument résider au Québec ou être prêt à y emménager pour que ta candidature soit considérée. Seules les personnes dont la candidature est retenue seront contactées pour la suite.
Petit conseil pour mettre toutes les chances de ton côté : dis-nous concrètement comment tu utilises l’IA au quotidien dans ton développement.

VOUS FAITES QUOI CHEZ TLM?

On est né en 2003, on a donc plus de 20 ans! On est des développeurs et des développeuses de produits logiciels. On choisit des idées de produits technologiques (les nôtres ou celles d’autres entrepreneurs et entrepreneuses visionnaires). On brainstorm dessus, on propose les bonnes fonctionnalités, on choisit les bonnes technologies, on les code, on les livre. On les maintient et on les fait évoluer sur le long terme. Parfois on conçoit du visuel, on met des produits en marché et on les vend. Mais surtout, on adore aider des entreprises et des startups à faire tout ça! C’est notre expertise [insère ici tout patois ou juron que tu juges pertinent, de notre côté, on aime ben verrat]!

ÇA FAIT QUOI UN.E DÉVELOPPEUR.EUSE ASSISTÉ.E EN IA CHEZ VOUS?

Tu fais du développement fullstack en Python et React, mais pas à l’ancienne : tu codes main dans la main avec l’intelligence artificielle, comme si tu avais R2-D2 branché direct sur ton laptop. Ton rôle, c’est de bâtir des solutions solides, d’améliorer la qualité du code, et d’utiliser des outils IA (Cursor, Agentic AI, Cucumber, Gherkin) pour t’éviter des bugs dignes d’un troll dans la Moria. Ici, l’IA, c’est ton sidekick (et surtout pas ton remplaçant). Il te permet de livrer plus vite et mieux, sans avoir à faire du debugging à répétition. Tu maîtrises l'art du context engineering et tes prompts sont aussi raffinés qu'un anneau forgé dans la montagne du destin. Tu collabores avec une petite équipe allumée, sans microgestion, et tu restes maître de ton code comme Gandalf face au Balrog.

SUIS-JE QUALIFIÉ.E POUR ÇA VOUS PENSEZ?

C’est à toi de nous le dire, non?

À la base, tu dois être capable de nous faire parvenir ton CV ou de répondre à notre p’tit quiz. À partir de là, même si on t’aime bien et qu’on apprécie ton intérêt, on pourra considérer ta candidat à titre de padawan de l'IA si :

T'as un diplôme en informatique
T'as un solide bagage en développement (5 ans ou plus)
Tu maîtrises Python comme un pro, React aussi (ou tu n’as pas peur de le dompter)
Tu connais ton CI/CD et le cloud assez pour ne pas finir enseveli sous une montagne de tickets
Tu utilises au quotidien des outils d'IA pour augmenter ta performance dans le code
T'es reconnu.e pour tes connaissances en prompt engineering et ta maîtrise du contexte, ce qui te permet de manipuler tes agents d'une main de maître.
Tu partages tes connaissances et aides tes collègues afin qu'ils puissent aussi profiter de la force de l'IA
T'es capable de prendre une idée, ou un besoin pas toujours clair, d’un client et de le traduire en fonctionnalités qui font du sens dans l’application
Tu sais garder ton sang-froid même quand les tests automatisés plantent
T'es autonome, tu prends des initiatives et tu fais preuve de proactivité
Tu collabores bien, tu expliques clairement tes idées et tu ne te gênes pas pour challenger tes coéquipiers (ou ton outil IA préf)
Tu vises la qualité avant de sortir du code à la pelletée
Tu restes curieux, même un lundi matin, avec ou sans ta tasse de café à la main

Bref, tu es un.e développeur.euse passionné.e des agents IA, avec plusieurs années derrière la cravate et ta stack de prédilection, c'est python.

TON PROFIL NOUS ALLUME SI :

T’es le genre à explorer un framework comme on explore Poudlard, sans attendre la permission du concierge
Tu as le réflexe de poser des questions et de fouiller, plutôt que de rester sur pause
Tu n’as pas peur d’apprendre de nouveaux outils IA, même s’ils ont des noms plus bizarres que les personnages du Seigneur des anneaux
Tu aimes qu’on relise ton code et que ça parte en mini joute de discussion (toujours amicale)
Tu es capable d’expliquer ton boulot à quelqu’un qui ne comprend rien au code, comme un oncle au party de famille
Tu collabores sans jouer au lone wolf et tu partages tes connaissances avec plaisir
Tu réussis à livrer du travail de qualité même en mode full télétravail (pas besoin qu’on te tienne la main)
Tu as un sens de l’humour qui survit à la tempête de GIFs geeks dans Slack
Tu cherches à t’améliorer en continu, un peu comme un build LEGO jamais vraiment terminé

OK. PIS POURQUOI TLM PLUS QU'UNE AUTRE PLACE? METTONS.

C’est une bonne question ça. Parce qu’on va se le dire, t’as pas mal de choix présentement. Mais la réalité, c’est que beaucoup d’entreprises embellissent leur milieu de travail. C’est comme dans les buffets, souvent les desserts ont l’air bons, mais ils goûtent le pas frais.

Voici ce qu’on t’offre :
Un emploi permanent, à temps plein et sur le long terme (on ne met pas les employés.es au chômage quand il y a un ralentissement ou une pandémie)
La conciliation famille-travail à son comble, des horaires flexibles/comprimées/all in (parce que « ta job < ta famille & ta santé »)
La reconnaissance des individus à part entière avec toutes leurs merveilleuses différences
Le défi de bâtir à partir de rien et de faire grandir (génial pour le complexe de Dieu ou de Déesse)
Un stack de technos vraiment abondants (tu vas avoir un éventail de choix pour t’amuser)
La diversité dans les tâches et le travail en équipe
Des défis et des projets vraiment motivants qui ne te laisseront jamais sur ta faim
Un programme de vacances et de REER pas piqué des vers
Un programme d’assurances collectives complet payé en partie par TLM
Un programme de redistribution des parts de nos projets entrepreneuriaux aux employés.es (on t’expliquera)
De l’argent pour t'équiper en télétravail et un montant annuel subséquent pour te garder à jour
Windows, Linux, Mac, CentOS, portable ou non, selon tes choix et tes besoins
Un club social qui va te crinquer comme jamais
La plus belle terrasse pour travailler à l’extérieur de tout Chicoutimi (désolé si t’es ailleurs)
Et on en passe!

Au bout de tout ça? Un bonheur au travail augmenté! Tu l’sais que la vie est courte. Et on passe une trop grande partie de notre vie éveillée au travail (en supposant qu’on ne dort pas sur la job) pour ne pas aimer ce qu’on fait ou pour se sentir comme un numéro. Ça fait que vient BÂTIR ton job de rêve avec nous autres!

Consulte la page Avantages pour en savoir plus!

OK. Dernière question. Ça veut dire quoi TLM?

Pour accéder à la réponse officielle, tu dois te joindre à notre équipe de plus de 80 employés.es et devenir l’un de nos ninjas certifiés ou l’une de nos ninjettes certifiées (oui, on le sait que le vrai mot c’est kunoichis. C’est juste moins sympathique). En attendant, pour toi ça veut dire «Trouve Le Meilleur emploi».",[]
